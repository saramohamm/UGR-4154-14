                <h2>My life story</h2>
                <p>I am Sara Mohammed, born in Saudi Arabia in November 2002, the first child of my parents, Rukiya and Mohammed. Growing up, my early years were filled with the joy of learning, and at the age of six, I came to Ethiopia, continuing my educational path. Throughout my schooling, I consistently ranked first and second in the class, showing my commitment to academic excellence. Today, I am a student of Addis Ababa University, where my passion for knowledge and curiosity find new avenues. Beyond academics, I am a religious individual who cherishes the beauty of nature, making each day a unique and enriching experience. My journey reflects a blend of diverse experiences, shaping me into the person I am today.</p>
